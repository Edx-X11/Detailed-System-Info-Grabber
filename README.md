# Ultra Advanced System Discovery Tool

Welcome to the Ultra Advanced System Discovery Tool! This tool provides information about your system, including system details, network information, and more. You can choose from different versions of the script based on your preferred programming language.

## Rust Version

The Rust version of the script provides detailed system information using the `sysinfo` crate. It displays system details, network information, USB devices, and more.

To run the Rust script:

1. Make sure you have Rust installed.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Navigate to the Rust script directory: `cd rust_version`.
4. Build and run the script: `cargo run`.

## C++ Version

The C++ version of the script displays system details, network information, USB devices, and more using standard C++ libraries.

To run the C++ script:

3. Compile and run the script: `g++ system_discovery.cpp -o system_discovery && ./system_discovery`.

## Python Version

The Python version of the script uses the `psutil` and `netifaces` libraries to display system details, network information, USB devices, and more. It also uses the `pyusb` library for USB device detection (optional).

To run the Python script:

2. Clone this repository.
3. Navigate to the Python script directory: `cd python_version`.
4. Install dependencies (if needed): `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
5. Run the script: `python system_discovery.py`.

## Java Version 

The Java version of the script displays system details and network information without the USB device detection feature. It uses standard Java libraries.

To run the Java script:

1. Make sure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Navigate to the Java script directory: `cd java_version`.
4. Compile the code: `javac AdvancedSystemDiscoveryTool.java`.
5. Run the script: `java AdvancedSystemDiscoveryTool`.

Feel free to choose the version that suits your preferences and enjoy exploring your system's details!
